## 2026-08-25 — ChatGPT — Initial reverse-engineering handoff

**Objective**

Replace unreliable video/OCR-based Huuuge Casino activity research with structured client data collection.

**Actions**

- Connected to BlueStacks through ADB and identified package `com.huuuge.casino.slots`.
- Pulled base and split APKs from the user's BlueStacks installation.
- Analyzed `base.apk` and `split_config.arm64_v8a.apk`.
- Identified `libClawApp.so` as the main native analysis target.
- Confirmed Lua integration and a custom `.zpk` resource ecosystem.
- Recovered serialized protobuf descriptors from the native binary.
- Reconstructed 36 `.proto` schemas and generated a descriptor set.
- Reconstructed RPC service/method mappings.
- Recovered Battle Pass milestone/mission/update field structures.
- Designed a passive Frida hook around `Casino::Connection::WriteMessage`, `HandleRequest`, and `HandleResponse`.
- Created `agent.js` and `live_decode.py` to serialize/copy `Casino::RpcMessage` and decode payloads through the recovered descriptors.
- Tested BlueStacks root/debug state: current instance has working ADB but no usable root or `su`; `run-as` is unavailable.

**Confirmed results**

- Android: 9.
- Emulator ABI list: `x86_64,x86,arm64-v8a,armeabi-v7a,armeabi`.
- Huuuge `primaryCpuAbi=arm64-v8a`.
- Current normal instance: ADB-accessible but not rootable through the tested `adb root` path.
- `libClawApp.so` contains protobuf-generated symbols/descriptors and Lua integration.
- 36 protobuf schema descriptors recovered successfully.

**Current blocker**

Dynamic Frida attach has not yet been established because the existing BlueStacks instance lacks usable root. BlueStacks installation/data paths also differ from assumed defaults and must be discovered automatically.

**Files produced**

- `HUUUGE_CODEX_HANDOFF.md`
- `CODEX_KICKOFF_PROMPT.md`
- `artifacts/recovered/*`
- `artifacts/live_probe/*`

**Next recommended action**

Codex should automatically discover the real BlueStacks install/data/config paths, identify or create an isolated research clone, validate the native bridge/runtime architecture, and establish Frida attach without modifying the user's normal instance.

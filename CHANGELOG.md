### Added

- Initial Huuuge Android research repository structure.
- Full technical handoff from the ChatGPT investigation.
- Recovered protobuf descriptor set and 36 recovered `.proto` schemas.
- Service/method RPC mapping and Battle Pass schema notes.
- Initial Frida live probe (`agent.js`) and protobuf decoder (`live_decode.py`).
- Collaboration protocol (`AGENTS.md`), canonical status (`CURRENT_STATUS.md`), and shared operator log (`COLLAB_LOG.md`).
